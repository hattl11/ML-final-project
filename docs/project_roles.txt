1. Data & Preprocessing Lead (Zubair & Imaad) 
Responsibilities
Load the CIC-IDS2017 Wednesday dataset.


Handle missing values, remove Heartbleed flows, relabel DoS variants → attack, others → benign.


Scale/normalize features, encode categorical columns.


Create the required 20-row snapshot for submission.


Document data-cleaning steps in the notebook.




2. Modeling Lead (Hattie)
Responsibilities
Train baseline supervised models (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression).


Tune hyperparameters and document methodology.


Compare models on precision/recall/F1/AUC and pick one final model.


Save model and preprocessing pipeline for inference.




3. Evaluation & Validation Lead
Responsibilities
Design and run validation strategy (e.g., time-based split to avoid leakage).


Generate confusion matrices, ROC/PR curves.


Aggregate and interpret metrics.


Ensure reproducibility (fixed random seeds, same scaling, etc.).




4. Documentation & ADR Lead 
Responsibilities
Draft the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) explaining data prep, model choice, evaluation rationale, and results.


Gather visuals from teammates and integrate them into the final notebook/presentation.


Ensure the notebook reads cleanly and meets the project’s formatting guidelines.




5. Presentation & Integration Lead (Lingjie)
Responsibilities
Combine all notebook sections, check code runs cleanly.


Design slides for the final presentation.


Coordinate the narrative (problem → method → results → takeaway).


Lead or co-lead the group presentation.
